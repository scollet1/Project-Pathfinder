  - [ ] construct domain
    - [ ] map domain to a data structure. This is a data-agnostic structure starting at [100][100] and scaling by [HEIGHT][WIDTH]. Each space should be initilized by calculating density and supplying a value [0, 1] where 0 is empty and 1 is an agent. The robot should be denoted by a 2 and should be spawned first.
